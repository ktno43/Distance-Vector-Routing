Contribution:
It was a group effort since we were both discussing how to code certain portions of the project.  We would be discussing through voice giving insight on how to handle certain features.

If the work were to be split then:
  Kyle Nguyen: Topology file establishment, routing updates, message format, server commands(server, update, step, packets, display, disable, crash, some server responses/output handling, cleanup, documentation.
  
  Kodi Winterer: Connection to other neighbors to send routing updates to, timeout period, and some server responses/output handling.
