Contribution:
It was a group effort since we were both discussing how to code certain portions of the project.  We would be discussing through voice giving insight on how to handle certain features and or pointing out what problems may have occured.

If the work were to be split then:
  Kyle Nguyen: Topology file establishment, routing updates, message encoding/decoding, server commands(server, update, step, packets, display, disable, crash, some server responses/output handling, cleanup, comments/documentation).
  
  Kodi Winterer: Connection to other neighbors to send routing updates, message sending/receiving, timeout period(disable and crash), and some server responses/output handling.
  
  Michael Shi: Testing/Quality control and checking functionality, server responses/output handling, help with message sending/receiving, and assisted in various components.
